                                <h2>What Are Instagram Views?</h2>
                                <p>Getting lots of views is a dream come true for people who want to earn an income from
                                    their Instagram accounts. Views refer to the number of users and the length of time
                                    they spend watching a video or an Instagarm Story that you posted.</p>
                                <p>Yet, views and likes are also difficult to build organically. Besides, there rules as
                                    to whether a view will be counted or not.</p>
                                <p>There are several conditions when a view can be counted in your account.</p>
                                <ul style={{listStyleType: "numeric"}}>
                                    <li> A user must watch a video for three seconds for it to earn you credits. A user
                                        can watch it twice and still be counted. You can also watch your videos for the
                                        same length of time.
                                    </li>
                                    <p>You can replay it once for three seconds and get a view. However, playing the
                                        same video again and again could be detected by Instagram, and doing it might
                                        bring you trouble, such as getting your account banned.. </p>
                                    <li>The videos must be watched on the Instagram app. Watching the same video on
                                        other platforms aside from Instagram will not be counted.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Hashtags play an important role in the video views you will get. People can use
                                        hashtags to look for what they want or need. If they happen to type a hashtag
                                        you used in your video, it will show up in the search results.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>To <span
                                        style={{fontWeight: 'bold'}}>get more Instagram video views,</span> post the
                                        videos between 8 and
                                        9a m or 8 and 9
                                        pm. Since many users are online during these times, many of them will view your
                                        post.
                                    </li>

                                <h2>Where to Get Instagram Views</h2>
                                <p>Views come from people who watch videos posted on your Instagram account, including
                                    you.
                                    Getting views may be hard especially if you have few likes and followers.</p>

                                <h3>1. Do Instagram views increase my internet visibility?</h3>
                                <p>The digital age has made social media an important partner in achieving successful
                                    brands and businesses. Today, Instagram leads the pack among the popular platform,
                                    with more than a billion users.</p>
                                <p>Instagram has become an engagement hub for internet users. Engagement includes liking
                                    content, commenting on it, sharing, and viewing videos and images. The more likes,
                                    followers, comments, and views you have, the easier other platform users will find
                                    you.</p>
                                <p>Every time someone watches a video or image on your Instagram for three seconds, you
                                    can get a view. The posts that are mostly viewed are shared by Instagram with other
                                    users through their feeds.
                                    These views can prop up your online popularity which may bring more business
                                    opportunities.
                                </p>
                                <h3>2. How can buying Instagram views help me?</h3>
                                <p>The more Instagram users view your posts, the more chances you have of being viewed
                                    by other users. It is human instinct to investigate when something exciting happens.
                                    Getting many views, comments, shares, and likes will motivate others to see why you
                                    are so popular.</p>
                                <p>They will visit your Instagram account to see what causes the excitement. They must
                                    view the videos others were watching and stay long enough for Instagram to count the
                                    activity. Once you gain many viewers, your video and photos will be fed by Instagram
                                    to other users, making them easy to find online.</p>
                                <p>Buying Instagram views will be a good starting point to have a big number of views
                                    that looks organic</p>
                                <h3>3. Is it important that I buy Instagram views from your website only?</h3>
                                <p>You can buy Instagram views from several websites. But, not all of them offer
                                    high-quality views.
                                    If you want to get real views, visit us to make your order. You can get your order
                                    instantly. However, we will not feed your account with the views for a single time.
                                    We will do it gradually to make it look natural.
                                </p>
                                <p>If you will have problems, we have our customer support team to help you resolve the

                                <h3>4. In what way do buying views help my brand or business?</h3>
                                <p>Getting a big number of views will have an impact on your business or brand. Yet,
                                    when you do not have enough views, it is quite difficult to level up your
                                    business.</p>
                                <p>Buying views can greatly help. A video with many views is usually fed by Instagram to
                                    other users. Your account will enjoy a wider reach and more exposure. These people
                                    can become sales leads and later, get converted into buying customers.</p>
                                <h3>5. When do I receive the views I have bought?</h3>
                                <p>We offer instant delivery of views that you buy. We avoid feeding all views at once.
                                    Instead, we do it gradually within three days or more. The increase in views will
                                    look natural. As other users interact with you and with each other, you can expect
                                    to have more views. </p>
                                <h3>6. Do I need to provide my login details to buy views?</h3>
                                <p>We will not as you for your login details. You only need to provide your username and
                                    email on Instagram. Rest assured that we will safeguard the safety of your account
                                    and we will never compromise it.</p>
                                <h2>Likes vs. Views</h2>
                                <p>Many Instagram users wonder how likes and views are counted. Likes are represented by
                                    a heart on Instagram. The number of likes is equal to the number of hearts. </p>
                                <p>Views, on the other hand, are counted as long as you view the video in three seconds
                                    or more. This means that even if you do not like the video but watched it, it is
                                    counted as a view.</p>
                                <p>Instagram views refer to viewing videos and Instagram stories. Looking at photos is
                                    not counted as a view. Watching a video for less than three seconds will not be
                                    counted, either.</p>
                                <p>To ensure that you get views, create interesting videos and stories to attract
                                    traffic to your Instagram account. After the automated feed of views that you have
                                    bought from us, you can expect more views from other users who are attracted to your
                                    videos and stories.</p>
                                <p>Here are some questions regarding Instagram views and how they impact your visibility
                                    online.</p>

                                <p>The ideal length of an Instagram story is 15 seconds. Yet, you can also make it seven
                                    seconds. If your story is long, you can divide it into several segments of 15
                                    seconds each. Stories that are longer are still allowed but, you will need a tool to
